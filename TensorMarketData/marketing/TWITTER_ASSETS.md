## Launch Tweet (Thread)

**Tweet 1:**
AI agents need reliable data. That's harder than it sounds.

Most agents are flying blind, using web search or guessing.

We built a better way.

A thread 🧵 on TensorMarketData 👇

**Tweet 2:**
TensorMarketData is a headless B2B data marketplace for AI agents.

🎯 Find suppliers via natural language
📊 Real-time inventory checks
🔗 Agent-ready webhooks
💳 Pay-per-query credits

All structured, verified data from 50K+ suppliers.

**Tweet 3:**
Why AI agents need their own data layer:

1. Web search is too slow
2. Data is messy, unstructured
3. Verification is hard
4. Scale is impossible manually

We solved all four.

**Tweet 4:**
Here's how it works:

```
pip install tensormarket

from tensormarket import Client
client = Client(api_key="...")

# Natural language search
results = client.search("manufacturers in Ohio")

# Check inventory
inventory = client.get_inventory(supplier_id)
```

AI agents can now find suppliers in milliseconds.

**Tweet 5:**
