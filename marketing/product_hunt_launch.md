- **API-First**: Search, purchase, and download via code—no dashboards required
- **Agent-Native**: Designed for autonomous AI agents that need autonomous data sourcing
- **Developer Experience**: SDKs, documentation, and code examples included

### Early Traction

In private beta, TensorMarketData attracted:
- 500+ developers on waitlist
- 50+ verified datasets listed
- 10+ data partner agreements
- $50K+ in committed spend from early adopters

### Quote

"Data is the final moat in AI development," said [Founder Name]. "The company that makes quality data as accessible as cloud compute will define the next decade of artificial intelligence. We're building that infrastructure."

### Availability

TensorMarketData is now available in public beta. Early access is free for developers.
