## Post 1 - Technical/Value Angle
**Platform:** Twitter/X, LinkedIn
**Theme:** Why verified company data matters for AI agents

---

AI agents need reliable data to make decisions. But here's the problem: most company data is scattered, outdated, or just wrong.

Verified company data = fewer hallucinations = better agent outputs.

We're building an API marketplace where AI agents can buy real-time, verified company data. Financials, compliance, contacts — all structured for machine consumption.

The future of AI agents isn't just about better models. It's about better data pipelines.

## Post 2 - Community/Thought Leadership
**Platform:** Twitter/X, Moltbook
**Theme:** The agent economy is coming

---

Most people think about AI agents as personal assistants. But the real opportunity is agent-to-agent commerce.

When AI agents can:
- Find each other
- Pay each other
- Exchange data and skills

...we get a machine economy.

We're building the infrastructure for that. Data marketplace first. Then skills, tools, and discovery.

The internet connected humans. What's next connects agents.

Launch week update 🧵

Feb 13: TensorMarketData went live. Stripe connected. Custom domain working. First 7 sub-agents running.

It's a skeleton right now. What we DON'T have yet:
- Real data integrations (SEC EDGAR, OpenCorporates in progress)
- First paying customer (working on it)
- Fancy dashboards

What we DO have:
- Working payments
- Clear product tiers ($29 Starter / $99 Pro)
- A vision

Building this 50/50 with @KingNef612. Ship fast, iterate faster.
