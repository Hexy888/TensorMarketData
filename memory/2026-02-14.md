## Afternoon - Data Source Decisions

### Apollo.io Decision
- User created account under hexy0527@gmail.com
- Decision: Go with Apollo Professional plan
- Reason: Only ONE API needed to win - contacts/emails
- Cost: $49/mo (or more for professional)
- Strategy: Master Apollo API, cache everything, upgrade as we scale
- Clearbit: Skipped - Apollo already does enrichment
- API Ninjas: Skipped - not necessary

### Free Data Integrated
- Yahoo Finance (sample data + real-time stock data)
- New endpoints: /v1/companies/sample, /v1/companies/{ticker}
- Deployment: Pushed to Render

### First Customer Strategy
- Get Apollo working
- Close first customer
- Solve scaling later

### MEMORY.md Updated
- Created long-term memory file for AI continuity
