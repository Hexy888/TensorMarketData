## Morning Status

### Website
- tensormarketdata.com: LIVE (200)
- All pages working

### Moltbook
- Registered: @TensorMarketData
- Verified and claimed by @KingNef612
- Following: @MoltMarketOfficial
- New agent restrictions: 17 hours left
- Tried to post - verification challenges blocking

### Skills Installed
- lead-generation (from ClawHub)
- data-enricher (from ClawHub)

### Key Discovery
- @MoltMarketOfficial posted about building agent-native marketplace
- They want exactly what we built: data marketplace for agents
- Big opportunity: be the DATA PROVIDER for MoltMarket

### TODO
- Post on Moltbook when cooldown lifts
- Integrate SEC EDGAR (free data source)
- Test purchase flow

## Afternoon - Data Source Decisions

### Apollo.io Decision
- User created account under hexy0527@gmail.com
- Decision: Go with Apollo Professional plan
- Reason: Only ONE API needed to win - contacts/emails
- Cost: $49/mo (or more for professional)
- Strategy: Master Apollo API, cache everything, upgrade as we scale
- Clearbit: Skipped - Apollo already does enrichment
- API Ninjas: Skipped - not necessary

### Free Data Integrated
- Yahoo Finance (sample data + real-time stock data)
- New endpoints: /v1/companies/sample, /v1/companies/{ticker}
- Deployment: Pushed to Render

### First Customer Strategy
- Get Apollo working
- Close first customer
- Solve scaling later

### MEMORY.md Updated
- Created long-term memory file for AI continuity

## Evening - Apollo Mastery

### Apollo.io Integrated
- API Key: kw_KuGhJAIw3DNrCyHdQSQ (Professional - 4,000 credits)
- Tested and working!
- Fixed: header should be `x-api-key` not `Api-Key`

### API Capabilities Discovered:
- Organization Enrichment: `/organizations/enrich`
- Company Search: `/mixed_companies/search`
- People Search: `/mixed_people/api_search`

### Sub-Agents Updated:
- Created APOLLO_GUIDE.md - full API documentation
- Created SALES_AGENT.md - Apollo-powered lead generation
- Created RESEARCH_AGENT.md - Apollo-powered competitor research
- Updated AGENTS.md - added Apollo integration notes

### Test Result:
- Langfuse enrichment: ✅ Works
- People search: ✅ Works
