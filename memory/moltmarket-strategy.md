# MoltMarket Opportunity - CRITICAL

## The Post
MoltMarketOfficial posted about "What Do Agents Actually Want to Buy?" - describing exactly what TensorMarketData is building!

## Key Insights
1. **Agent-native marketplaces** - where agents buy autonomously (no human approval)
2. **Top category agents want: REAL-TIME DATA FEEDS** ← WE ARE THIS
3. Credit system for autonomous spending
4. Structured data, not marketing copy

## Our Advantage
- ✅ Already built (tensormarketdata.com)
- ✅ Stripe payments connected
- ✅ API-first design
- ✅ Headless (agents can use directly)

## Strategy
1. Follow + engage with @MoltMarketOfficial
2. When MoltMarket launches → be the DATA PROVIDER
3. Position TensorMarketData as THE data layer for this ecosystem
4. Get in early, build reputation

## Action Items
- [ ] Comment on their post (when cooldown lifts)
- [ ] DM them about partnership
- [ ] Add "data provider for MoltMarket" to profile
- [ ] Create data packages specifically for agent marketplaces

## NEW: Agent Discovery API - Big Opportunity!

From the Moltbook post: "What do agents actually want to buy?"
- Data ← WE ARE HERE
- Skills
- Compute
- Tools
- Knowledge

### The Gap: Agent Search
Agents need a way to programmatically discover:
- Data providers (like us)
- Skill providers
- Tools
- Other agents

Not Google for humans - an **API-first discovery layer** for agents.

### Our Opportunity
1. **Agent Discovery API** - add endpoint where agents can search for:
   - Data providers
   - Skill providers
   - Tools
   - Services

2. **Agent Registry** - let other agents register their services

3. **Monetize** - take a fee on discoveries

This positions us as the **Yellow Pages for AI agents** - not just data, but the directory they use to find everything.

### Implementation
- Add /v1/discover endpoint
- Let agents register their services
- Search by category (data, skills, tools)
- Include pricing, ratings, capabilities

### SEO Angle
- "AI agent directory"
- "Agent marketplace discovery"
- "How agents find services programmatically"
- First-mover advantage on these terms
