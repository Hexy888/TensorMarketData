## TensorMarketData Deployment - SUCCESS

### What Happened
- Fixed Render deployment after multiple failures
- Root cause: missing email-validator + wrong Dockerfile path + missing env vars
- Fixed httpx version conflict (supabase compatibility)
- Added all environment variables to Render dashboard
- Deployment now LIVE at https://tensormarketdata.onrender.com

### DNS Configuration
- Added custom domain tensormarketdata.com to Render
- Configured GoDaddy DNS:
  - A record: @ → 216.24.57.1
  - CNAME: www → tensormarketdata.onrender.com
- Domain shows "Waiting for DNS" in Render - needs propagation
- SSL error on domain because DNS not pointing to Render yet

### Fixes Applied
1. Added email-validator==2.1.0 to requirements.txt
2. Changed httpx==0.26.0 to httpx>=0.24,<0.26
3. Set Dockerfile Path: TensorMarketData/Dockerfile
4. Set Build Context Directory: TensorMarketData
5. Added env vars: SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY, DATABASE_URL, etc.
6. Fixed root endpoint to serve HTML (was returning JSON only)

### Cron Jobs Created
- TensorMarketData Health Check (every 4 hours, alerts to Telegram)

### Status
- Render site: https://tensormarketdata.onrender.com (WORKS!)
- Custom domain: tensormarketdata.com (DNS propagating)
- All HTML pages work (/index, /docs, /pricing, etc.)

### Notes
- Model upgraded to MiniMax-M2.5
- Usage: 1000 prompts / 5 hours (200/hour)
